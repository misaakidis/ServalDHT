{\Large \bf \noindent Abstract} \\[0.13cm]

\noindent The concept of the Internet has radically changed since its first onset, around half a century ago; millions of multi-homed users, often moving across networks, are asking for data and services offered by multiple servers, which can be replicated and situated in various geographical locations.
Yet only a few modifications managed to consolidate and provide the framework for communicating in the largest computer network.

This situation is leading to erratic band-aids where network administrators and developers overload the existing network abstractions or resort to middleware, in order to provide the supplementary functionality needed by a network where services and data become first-class citizens.

In this thesis we are introducing the approach of Service-Aware Networking, a consolidation of Service-Centric abstractions and the Software Defined Networking (SDN)\nomenclature{SDN}{Software Defined Networking} paradigm.

Starting with an explanation of the principles behind Service-Centric networking, we are focusing on the Serval architecture along with its functional prototype.
Results of benchmarks are presented juxtaposed to the measurements of the unmodified TCP/IP stack.

Finally we are suggesting that Software Defined Networking could benefit from Serval's service-level data/control plane separation and enable services running in – possibly distributed – datacenters to automatically, and according to the rights they have been granted, manipulate virtual networks to better utilize the underlying network infrastructure, conforming to their dynamic needs.\\[0.1cm]

{\Large \bf \noindent Introduction} \\[0.5cm]
The aim of this report is to give a thorough depiction of the current progress in the preparation of ServalDHT, a decentralized system for resolving serviceIDs in the Serval Architecture \cite{Nordstrom2012}.
ServalDHT utilizes Distributed Hash Tables \nomenclature{DHT}{Distributed Hash Table} as a peer-powered DNS \nomenclature{DNS}{Domain Name System}  alternative in order to enable users locate service providers using a human readable service name.
Because of its nature, ServalDHT faces issues of security, agility and robustness in real-world scenarios, and experiments should demonstrate that it confronts them with great success before it can be widely adopted.\\
\indent This report comes as a result of methodical study of existing systems and reasoning on how to propose a solid, grounded on well-known resources yet innovative solution to improve their scalability and adaptability.
First, in sections 1 and 2, it is discussed the general idea of the problems this thesis expects to elucidate, the importance of them and their consequences.
Then, in the following two sections, it is outlined the theoretical background acquired by analyzing extant proposals and researching on relative topics.\\
\indent Finally, in sections 5 and 6 follows a brief introduction on the proposed solution, its main features and how it is going to diminish the inconveniences stated before, along with the expected results of the future implementation and its strain testing.

\label{sec:reviewbibliography}
ServalDHT is a multifaceted architecture that combines ideas from a wide spectrum of topics, including but no limited to Large Scale Network Architectures, Network Protocol Layers, Service-Centric Networking, Software Defined Networking, Distributed Hash Table algorithms and security issues of their various implementations, Peer-To-Peer Lookup Services as a replacement to legacy DNS etc.
Therefore references should contain an adequate number of publications on all those themes.\\
\indent The publications that have been used so far as a source of information follow in section 7.
Brief summaries can be found in Appendix at the end of the report.
