\section{The Serval Networking Architecture}
\subsection{Introduction}
Serval\footnote{More information about the Serval Architecture can be found in the presentation in the Appendix (\ref{sec:servaldhtpres}).} is an end-host stack evolving into a service-centric network architecture, proposed and prototyped by the \href{https://sns.cs.princeton.edu/}{systems and networking group} at \href{https://www.princeton.edu}{Princeton University}, in 2012.



\paragraph{} In the original paper "A Service Access Layer, at Your Service" (2011)\cite{Freedman2011} and later on "Serval: An End-Host Stack for Service-Centric Networking" (2012)\cite{Nordstrom2012}, Freedman, Nordstr{\"o}m et. al. first decompose the needs of modern networked applications, locate the discordances with the current Network Stack, study previous work and how each of them individually fails to stand as a proper solution, rethink the current TCP/IP Networking Stack and propose two simple abstractions that can obliterate the legacy problems discussed on Problem Definition (section \ref{problemdefinition}).

Furthermore they investigate how those abstractions fit in a new 3.5 layer, the Service Access Layer (SAL)\nomenclature{SAL}{Service Access Layer}, and emphasize on the clean service-level data/control plane separation it imposes.
Additionally, they review a formally-verified end-to-end connection control protocol (ECCP) \nomenclature{ECCP}{End-to-End Connection Control Protocol}, which completes the Serval architecture as the end-host signalling channel. 
In the end, they focus on the SAL prototype and the lessons learned from building it.



\subsection{Proposed abstractions}
As expected for a problem with such a significance, various abstractions have been proposed in order to support the concept of Service-Centric networking.
Deciding the right abstractions premises first the detailed understanding of where a problem resides, and then the genuine intuition for conceiving the simple yet powerful generalizations that better conform with the current and future needs.
Those abstractions should be transparent enough for legacy ports and hot swapping with the prevalent systems, in the meantime powerful to break ground for future advancements.

We appraise the Serval abstractions of \emph{Service Names} and \emph{Flow Identifiers} for being a great solution on the overloading of identifiers within and across the present TCP/IP stack.
Also, for the tight fit of those abstractions in the separation of data and control plane.
Finally, it is remarkable how the adoption of those abstractions requires minimal if no modifications at all in the infrastructure that powers networks today.



\subsubsection{Service Names}
The main idea behind Service-Centric Networking is that nowadays network users request services by their names and are completely agnostic of the underlying procedures.
Hereby an abstraction is needed for identifying a service, resolving and of course effectively routing a request to an instance of that service, according to specific rules.
For that reason Serval introduces service names, or \emph{serviceIDs}.

ServiceIDs are large (256 bit long) strings, that correspond to a service, or a group of services.
Part of Serval packets as a Service Access Extension header in the synchronization process (SYN and SYN-ACK flags in ECCP state machine figure \ref{fig:EECP_sm}), serviceIDs assist in resolution, late binding and service-level routing.
Furthermore they are used as persistent, global identifiers for easier handling of replicated services, virtual machine migrations or mobile hosts, when there is a need for end-point signaling.

What is unique about Serval's abstraction of service identifiers is that since they are managed by the SAL, they are positioned below the transport layer.
Jointly with Serval active sockets, the abstraction of service names obscures host identifiers (IP and Port) from the application layer, but stills offers powerful, familiar APIs\nomenclature{API}{Application Programming Interface} to networked application developers.

Notably, likewise to IP hierarchical notation, serviceIDs can well support a hierarchical address assigning scheme.
In other words, serviceID blocks can be allocated to service providers to assign to their own applications, in a long-prefix matching settlement.
We are discussing extensively hierarchical resolution later on section \ref{sec:hierresol}.

To sum up, in an elegant way serviceIDs promote services to the principal entities in the network, by giving applications intermediate access to the service control plane and a
And it manages to do so while hiding unneeded abstractions, such as the $<IP, port>$ tuple.



\subsubsection{End-host flow identifiers}
The other problem Serval is intending to counteract, is the limitations of PF\_INET sockets' tight binding to the stack.
Since the one responsible for demultiplexing incoming packets is the transport layer, and does so based on identifiers confined to local and remote interfaces, modifying any of those identifiers breaks the connection.
Then is appointed to the protocol to take action in restoring the communication channel.
This issue causes diminished connectivity mutability, forces the overloading of the five tuple $<remote IP, remote port, local IP, local port, protocol>$ across the network stack, and requires the re-implementation of failover functionality by individual protocols.

Serval, and specifically the Service Access Layer, detaches the process of local demultiplexing and provides to the upper layers a single identifier: the \emph{flowID}.
Flows, a notion used before to describe "virtual" network streams, find place in the SAL as the abstraction of socket numbers.
They resemble, in a way, a direct pointer to the local and remote sockets, no matter in which interface, IP address or port they are connected.

\label{fig:EECP_sm}
\end{figure}

This gives the freedom to applications --or even virtual machines-- establish multiple flows, possibly in different interfaces, push and receive traffic to any of them (or a combination of them, increasing bandwidth), without implementing any additional functionality in the protocol residing in the transport layer, or the application.
Everything is settled by the SAL, and a provably correct end-host signalling protocol (figure \ref{fig:EECP_sm}).

When it comes to implementation, flowIDs are 32bit unsigned integers and are end-host specific.
They are created during the synchronization of a new connection and are stored in SAL's flow table, serving as rules for demultiplexing incoming packets to the appropriate sockets.
Source and destination flowIDs are also part of the Serval header in every packet, sitting in the first 64 bits following the IP header.
FlowIDs are persistent throughout the lifecycle of the socket, no matter the modifications of any of the values of the five tuple.

\subsection{Service Resolution}
Service names by definition are human readable strings similar to domain names, for identifying services.
Consequently they are in a format that is incompatible to Serval active sockets API.
A service is needed, for mapping those hexadecimal strings to serviceIDs, so they can traverse the network in the service-level routing process described in the previous section.

Serval does not dictate the way service names are resolved to service instances.
In this section we discuss the different approaches in service resolution, a crucial component of any architecture that aims to be adopted in a wide scale.

What we consider important highlighting, is the belief that not always all clients will want to be part of the same service resolution scheme.
In the beginning of the chapter, we discussed the specificities of consumer and peer-to-peer networks.
Based on today's Internet status, it is safe to assume that the hierarchical resolution model with managing authorities could prevail.
But we can be sure that independent, flat resolution services will emerge in a completely separate namespace, over the same or different network wiring.
Still, developers are the ones who will make the final decision on how client applications resolve a serviceID and reach a service instance, much alike the way it is now.



\subsubsection{Resolution based on a priori knowledge}
Like in the beginning of the Internet, for the moment Serval applications use hardcoded serviceIDs to reach a service.
Violating in a way the service name abstraction, in this transitional stage, serviceIDs are either defined as constants or passed to the program as arguments.
A preordained hashing algorithm and other conventions are used for orchestrating the service registration and resolution, defining in a manner the namespace bounds.
This technique can also be useful in ad hoc (computer-to-computer) networks, when a client needs to reach a service and there are no service resolution services available.


\subsubsection{Hierarchical Resolution}
\label{sec:hierresol}
Relative to today's domain name system, serviceIDs, much like URIs.

\subsubsection{Flat Resolution Schemes}
Another approach suggests that serviceIDs are calculated by a hash function on a service prefix and an application-level instance unique key.
This practice of a \emph{semantic-free, flat} namespace better supports networks without a hierarchical structure, like datacenter and Wide Area networks.
By semantic-free\cite{Walfisha2004} reference we mean that by default

\subsubsection{Service Access Layer}
Extra points go to Serval for being transport-protocol agnostic.
This means that developers may choose to use either TCP, UDP\nomenclature{UDP}{User Datagram Protocol}, ATP\nomenclature{ATP}{AppleTalk Transaction Protocol}, FCP\nomenclature{FCP}{Fibre Channel Protocol} or actually any transport protocol, since it is supported by SAL, without modifying the source code of their application.
This opens new windows for experimentation and innovation.
