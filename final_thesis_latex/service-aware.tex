\section{Software Defined,\\ Service-centric Networking}
A well thought Service centric architecture provides two things:
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt 
\parsep0pt
  \item the right abstractions for services, for developers and users to use
  \item a service-aware data/control plane split
\end{enumerate}

\label{fig:sal_plane_split}
\end{figure}

Confidently, Serval provably does well with both.
This makes us sceptical on if the control plane could be in a way merged with software defined networking APIs.
That way, the network stack could have control over the fabric of the network.
And service-related events could be propagated to SDN-enabled devices as well.

This is the concept behind Service-Aware Networking; 
Software Defined Networking could benefit from Serval's data/control plane separation and enable services running in – possibly distributed – datacenters to automatically, and according to the rights they have been granted, manipulate networks to better utilize the underlying network infrastructure, conforming to their dynamic needs.
In other words, applications using active sockets will be able to modify network topology, co-working with the Service Controller and a centralized SDN controller.
This way, Serval can enable SDN reach the end-host nodes, very much alike SDN-ready applications are currently doing.

A great potential is hidden behind the way service-level routing rules management can be propagated with the use of Service Controllers.
Specifically immediate, network-wide changes are possible with any modification in the Service table or with lower links going up and down.

Actually Serval has in a way its own counterpart software defined API, the \emph{Service Control API}.
One can say so, taking a look in the way Service Controllers are exchanging information with each other and with the Serval Routers.
The integration though with a well-established API, such as Openflow \cite{McKeown2008}, will provide the flexibility of managing OpenFlow switches devices, and writing routing rules on host/interface and service instance changes, in a dynamic policy-driven manner.

\subsection{Scenario: Service Registration as a Network Policy}
Let us imagine a simple case scenario in a datacenter network, which could benefit from the integration of OpenFlow APIs in a Serval-compatible controller.

A POX\footnote{POX is a platform for the rapid development and prototyping of network control software using Python, providing OpenFlow interfaces.\\ \url{http://www.noxrepo.org/pox/about-pox/}} controller is listening for Service Registrations.
Once the instance of a service binds on an active socket with a serviceID, let's say, serviceX, a service registration event is triggered in SAL, a DEMUX rule is added in SAL's service table and the Service Controller is activated.

The Service Controller of that machine is using Serval's Service Control API to notify other Serval-enabled nodes for the new instance.
The Service Controllers of the other machines who receive that message, add a rule for forwarding SYN packets with the destination serviceID equal to serviceX, to the machine which originated the service registration.
If there are other instances of the same service, then the IP address of the machine is added to the relative list of IPs for forwarding.

The Service Controller of the server running the service instance is also informing the SDN controller which is controlling the OpenFlow switches network fabric.
Since the SDN controller has a rule for making serviceX instances available to the outer world, forwarding rules are added in OpenFlow switches for creating paths for packets coming from away the datacenter.

Immediately and without human intervention, as soon as an interface binds on an active socket, it can start listening on requests from clients.
And this functionality is achieved by service-aware networking, mainly with the control-plane mechanisms provided by the service-centric architecture.

A similar case with a virtual machine\nomenclature{VM}{Virtual Machine} migration can be thought.
Serval's in-band signalling can maintain the connection of an active-socket and notify the other end about the new IP address.
Service Controller can inform the SDN controller to create the datapath from external clients to reach the VM with the new IP.
In no time, the VM service instance is ready to serve both existing and new clients, without resetting original sockets state.

\section{Introduction to the Proposed Solution}
User Serval as it is, but with a Distributed Service Resolution Service
\\Based on DHT algorithms
\\Run by tier-1 and ISPs, or by users in Autonomous networks
\\Secure identifiers
\\Flat namespace
\\Gets serviceID and
\\- either returns the (IP,Port) back to the client
\\- or forwards the packet directly to the service provider
\\- caches the (serviceID, IP) tuple for future use
\\Incrementally deployable and backwards compatible
\\written in C, running in the user space
\\accept service registration, checks HIP and inform the relative nodes
\\About the Service Controller:
\\will be running as a daemon in the userspace
\\will communicate with ServalDHT to resolve serviceIDs (hashed service names)
\\will enable delegation, load balancing etc as modules (maybe a configuration file?)
\\Draw a FSM for the SRS \nomenclature{SRS}{Service Resolution Service} (http://madebyevan.com/fsm/)
