ServalDHT
=========

ServalDHT is a decentralized system for resolving serviceIDs in the Serval Architecture (http://www.serval-arch.org/). ServalDHT utilizes Distributed Hash Tables as a peer-powered DNS alternative in order to enable users locate service providers using a human readable service name. Because of its nature, ServalDHT faces issues of security, agility and robustness in real-world scenarios, and experiments should demonstrate that it confronts them with great success before it can be widely adopted.
