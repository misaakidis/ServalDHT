\subsubsection{Porting a networked application to Serval}
There are many 

- Requires to rebuild the whole project with the new abstractions (serval active sockets) and include serval libraries

- Depends on the independence of the connectivity modules
if patterns like singleton then porting is easier
calls in many files then complexity arises

- Extra implemented functionality can cause unexpected runtime results
example: 2 levels of loadbalancing
